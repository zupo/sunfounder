# Playing with the SunFounder SensorKit for RPi

I bought https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B014PF05ZA/ref=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1 to teach myself the basics of electronics. Should be fun?

## Code

Since I'm a Python geek, this repo contains Python code for lessons in the SensorKit. The original source is at https://github.com/sunfounder/SunFounder_SensorKit_for_RPi2. 

Finally, there's a bunch of `*.nix` files that configure the RPi for comfortable work.
